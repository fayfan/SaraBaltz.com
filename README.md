## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

This template includes three Dockerfiles optimized for different package managers:

- `Dockerfile` - for npm
- `Dockerfile.pnpm` - for pnpm
- `Dockerfile.bun` - for bun

To build & run using Docker:

```bash
# For npm
docker build -t my-app .

# For pnpm
docker build -f Dockerfile.pnpm -t my-app .

# For bun
docker build -f Dockerfile.bun -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
â”œâ”€â”€ build/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client/    # Static assets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server/    # Server-side code
```
